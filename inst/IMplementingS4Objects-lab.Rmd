## 2 Part I: Implementing the GWASdata class
The process of designing and implementing a new class requires that the devel-
opper spends some time thinking about:

* what s/he wants to achieve exactly with the class,
* how is the class going to be used, by who, for doing what,
* what are the typical use cases,
* what is the typical size of the data that will be manipulated, small (< 1
Mb), big (> 100 Mb), very big (> 10 Gb),
* how the class will interact with other packages and classes in CRAN/Bioconductor,
* how the facilities provided by the class will ﬁt within the tools and ﬁle
formats commonly used inside or outside Bioconductor,
* etc...

It’s generally considered good design to avoid storing redundant information
(although some exceptions can be made for performance considerations) and to
keep things as simple as possible.
